Currently, I'm learning Python through a MOOC on Udemy. I have only understood the basics yet, such as the syntax and how to utilise lists and tuples. 


A project I found out about was Scapy (https://scapy.net)
Scapy is a software that allows the user to decode the packets of data transferred across the network. As  result, it allows one to oversee the network 
and understand what communication is taking place.	

Another project I thought of that utilises AI, was the development of a basic chat bot. Through the use of AI to create a program that can discern,
and choose a reply to a given statement by itself. Using chat histories and pieces of conversation from day to day life, it may be possible to 
allow the program to observe a pattern in conversation, hence allowing it to make better choices after each run.

Lastly, another project that I thought could implement AI was, using it to develop a program that can play through simple games like Pacman or
Minesweeper, where the procedure is relatively the same for each iteration and hence AI might be able to continually get better at such problems by 
repetitive practice.
